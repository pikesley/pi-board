    We can approximate π using nothing more than random numbers and some
    simple geometry: we throw darts at a square board of
    side 2r; within the square we inscribe a circle of radius r
    with its centre at (r, r). We count all of the 'throws'; if a dart lands
    within the quadrant, we also count a 'hit'.
  </p>
  <p>
    For a large number of throws, we see that:
  </p>
  <pre>
 hits    area_of_circle
------ = --------------
throws   area_of_square</pre>
  <p>
    Some half-remembered geometry and algebra tells us that:
  </p>
  <pre>
area_of_circle    π * r^2         π * r^2        π * r^2   π
-------------- = --------- = ----------------- = ------- = -
area_of_square   (2 * r)^2   (2 * r) * (2 * r)   4 * r^2   4</pre>
  <p>
    Or:
  </p>
  <pre>
        area_of_circle        hits
π = 4 * -------------- = 4 * ------
        area_of_square       throws</pre>
</div>
